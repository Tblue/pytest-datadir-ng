@pytest.fixture
def datadir(request):
    """
    Provides a "datadir" fixture which allows test functions to
    easily access resources in data directories. It was inspired
    by the `pytest-datadir plugin
    <https://github.com/gabrielcnr/pytest-datadir>`_.

    The "datadir" fixture behaves like a dictionary. Currently,
    only retrieving items using the ``d[key]`` syntax is supported.
    Things like iterators, ``len(d)`` etc. are not.

    How the fixture looks for resources is best described by an example.
    Let us assume the following directory structure for your tests:

    .. code-block:: none

        tests/
        +-- test_one.py
        +-- test_two.py
        +-- data/
        |   +-- global.dat
        +-- test_one/
        |   +-- test_func/
        |       +-- data.txt
        +-- test_two/
            +-- TestClass/
                +-- test_method/
                    +-- strings.prop

    The file ``test_one.py`` contains the following function::

        def test_func(datadir):
            data_path = datadir["data.txt"]

            # ...

    The file ``test_two.py`` contains the following class::

        class TestClass(object):
            def test_method(self, datadir):
                strings_path = datadir["strings.prop"]

                # ...

    When the ``test_func()`` function asks for the ``data.txt`` resource, the
    following directories are searched for a file or directory named ``data.txt``,
    in this order:

    - ``tests/test_one/test_func/``
    - ``tests/test_one/``
    - ``tests/data/``

    The path to the first existing file (or directory) is returned as a
    :class:`py.path.local` object. In this case, the returned path would be
    ``tests/test_one/test_func/data.txt``.

    When the ``test_method()`` method asks for the ``strings.prop`` resource,
    the following directories are searched for a file or directory with the name
    ``strings.prop``, in this order:

    - ``tests/test_two/TestClass/test_method/``
    - ``tests/test_two/TestClass/``
    - ``tests/test_two/``
    - ``tests/data/``

    Here, this would return the path
    ``tests/test_two/TestClass/test_method/strings.prop``.

    As you can see, the searched directory hierarchy is slighly different if a
    *method* instead of a *function* asks for a resource. This allows you to
    load different resources based on the name of the test class, if you wish.

    Finally, if a test function or test method would ask for a resource named
    ``global.dat``, then the resulting path would be ``tests/data/global.dat``
    since no other directory in the searched directory hierarchy contains
    a file named ``global.dat``. In other words, the ``tests/data/`` directory
    is the place for global (or fallback) resources.

    If a resource cannot be found in *any* of the searched directories, a
    :class:`KeyError` is raised.

@pytest.fixture
def datadir_copy(request, tmpdir):
    """
    Similar to the :func:`.datadir` fixture, but copies the requested resources to a temporary directory first so that
    test functions or methods can modify their resources on-disk without affecting other test functions
    and methods.

    Each test function or method gets its own temporary directory and thus its own fresh copies of the resources it
    requests.

    **Caveat:** Each time a resource is requested using the dictionary notation, a fresh copy of the resource is made.
    This also applies if a test function or method requests the same resource multiple times. Thus, if you modify a
    resource and need to access the *modified* version of the resource later, save its path in a variable and use that
    variable to access the resource later instead of using the dictionary notation multiple times::

        def test_foo(datadir_copy):
            # This creates the initial fresh copy of data.txt and saves
            # its path in the variable "resource1".
            resource1 = datadir_copy["data.txt"]

            # ...modify resource1 on-disk...

            # You now want to access the modified version of data.txt.

            # WRONG way: This will overwrite your modified version of the
            #            resource with a fresh copy!
            fh = open(datadir_copy["data.txt"], "rb")

            # CORRECT way: This will let you access the modified version
            #              of the resource.
            fh = open(resource1, "rb")
